 * Everything reachable from a controller node without passing through a

 * from, but nothing beyond it is reachable through it. (A closed valve used
 * as the controller itself still spreads both ways — it's where you started.)
 *
 * Breadth-first with an index pointer rather than `queue.shift()`, which is
 * O(n) per call and made the whole trace quadratic on a large network.
