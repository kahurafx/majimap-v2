 * Upstream/downstream from a node, approximated by hop distance from the
 * nearest source rather than true flow direction — there's no hydraulic
 * simulation yet to derive real direction from. "Upstream" only ever steps
 * strictly closer to a source; "downstream" steps anywhere that isn't, so in
 * a looped network it can move sideways across equal-distance nodes and may
 * disagree with reality near pressure-balanced points. A node with no path
 * to any source has no known direction: upstream from it is just itself, and
 * downstream is everything connected to it. Replace with the solver's flow
 * directions once they exist; the signature shouldn't need to change.
 *
 * Closed valves are included but not traced through (unless you start there).
